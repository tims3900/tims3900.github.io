        <h1>Kelp Coverage Calculation from UAV Imagery</h1>
        <h2>MBARI Summer Internship Project</h2>

        <p>Developed an automated pipeline to calculate kelp canopy coverage from standard RGB drone imagery, eliminating the need for expensive multi-spectral cameras. Processed 26,000+ high-resolution images across 6 Monterey Bay sites to monitor kelp forest health.</p>

        <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
        <p><strong>Problem Inversion:</strong> Instead of segmenting fragmented kelp patches directly, the uniform water background was segmented instead and mask was inverted - much more reliable since water appears as cohesive regions.</p>
        <p><strong>SAM + SAHI Integration:</strong> Combined Segment Anything Model with Slicing Aided Hyper Inference to process 42-megapixel images efficiently. The pipeline automatically slices large images into manageable patches with intelligent overlap handling.</p>
        <p><strong>Smart Seed Point Generation:</strong> Developed automated algorithms to place optimal seed points for SAM using color analysis and Poisson disk sampling, ensuring comprehensive water region capture.</p>

        <h3>Results:</h3>
        <p>Successfully processed 26,000+ images from 6 survey sites<br>
            Created ground truth dataset through manual annotation and vegetation indices<br>
